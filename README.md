<h1> What is "Proximity Chat?" </h1>
Proximity chat is an android application which allows users to discover other users within a small geographical distance and send messages and media to each other without the need for an internet connection by using Wi-Fi Direct.
An Android application that allows users to message each other wirelessly, <b>without the need for an internet or cellular connection</b>. This is allowed by the use of <b>Wi-Fi Direct (or Wi-Fi P2P)</b> technology in order to connect the devices. 
<p>

This solves the problem of an insufficient or unreliable network connection by eliminating the need for an internet connection entirely and allowing users to communicate exclusively through Peer-to-Peer messaging. This means that users who previously did not have any access to the internet, will have the ability to message users within their geographical proximity.
<p>

For a user to connect to another user on this ‘Proximity Chat’, they only require their devices to be within a 200-metre radius of each other; this radius the Wi-Fi Direct discovery range. After users are within each others’ discovery range, they can request a connection between each other which can only be made if there is a mutual agreement between the two users in the form of a prompt. If a user rejects this connection request, no connection is made. 
Once users have connected to each other, they will be able to freely message one another in the form of either text messages or images. 

<h2> How do I use this app?</h2>  
Using Proximity Chat is easy. All you need is 2 Android devices with Wi-Fi P2P enabled.
